# Webpage
This repository holds the webpage for the community

If you want to edit the webpage (as a member of the community), then please do. 

The main page is stored in [index.md]

You can add a subsidiary page by making a file called [another-page.md], and then linking to it from the index.md via `[Link to another page](./another-page.html)`.
